Q_2) History of JS?

JavaScript, often referred to as JS, started in the mid-1990s when Netscape, a web browser company, wanted a way to make web pages more interactive. Originally called Live Script, it later became JavaScript. Despite its name, it's different from Java. In 1997, it was standardized as ECMAScript. During the early 2000s, JS became crucial in web development, allowing websites to change and update without needing to reload. This led to Web 2.0, where sites got much more interactive. In 2015, ECMAScript 6 brought many improvements, and Node.js in 2009 allowed JS to run on servers, not just in browsers. Today, JavaScript is a vital part of web and app development, constantly evolving to create dynamic and engaging online experiences.
